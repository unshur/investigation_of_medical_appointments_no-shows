# Investigation of Medical Appointments No-Shows

## Ahmed Unshur


This project investigates medical appointments no-shows in Brazil. The project uses data from 100K appointments and its original source is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments).
The project is descriptive in nature and was completed as part of Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) program.
After wrangling, exploring, and analyzing the data, we have reached the following results:

1.  Percentage of patients that didn't show up for their medical appointments was 20%, whereas that of those who did represented to 80%.
2.  Percentage of female patients represented to 65%% , and that of males 35%. Gender doesn't play a role in appointment no shows.
3.  Average age of patients was 37 years, and younger patients tend to not show up for appointments compared to senior patients.
4.  Percentage of patients that didn't receive reminder SMS messages was 68%, while that of those who did represented to 32%. Patients that received messages missed appointment more than those who didn't.

A limitation of this project is that its descriptive and explanatory, and becuase of that we cannot make causal inferences. Further investigation is required.

To complete this project, we have used Anaconda, Python and some of its packages and libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) and Jupyter Notebook.
